Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my **little** corner of the internet.

My name is Alfredo NarvÃ¡ez Docimo, and I'm a javascript enthusiast. I help people through software and love sharing my experiences and insights with others. That's how this blog was born!

I've always been fond of computing, ever since I was little and got my first PC.
I remember it seemedÂ likeÂ theÂ coolestÂ thingÂ everÂ watchingÂ *clippy*Â pop up andÂ interactingÂ withÂ him.

One of the main things that got me into web dev was the fact that I started making flash games. You know, back when flash a big deal and every website was using it. This helped me get in touch with the main concepts of programing. This was about the time when I knew I wanted to pursue this my fulltime career.

What I could not learn from college I learned by myself. I am very keen on the idea of self-learning and being self-taught. Once your mind reaches that state, you know its only a matter of time before you actually go from barely knowing about a subject to being proficient. I believe that the key to all of it is a combination of dedication, motivation, and discipline.

Frontend is my pasion. Is not something that I just do for a living, but rather something that I sit down to read a lot about. New upcoming technologies, patterns, good practices, where is it heading, new trends. It fascinates me!

Throughout my career I've encountered a number of curious things that I wish I'd known when stepping into the web dev world. This is my way of giving back to the community, by creating content that will, hopefully, help new entry level developers and experienced devs alike.

Feel free to take a look around, and I really hope you find something interesting here!

Happy hacking! âœŒ
