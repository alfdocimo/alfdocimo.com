> A person who thinks all the time, has nothing to think about except thoughts. So.. he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of illusions. By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull. Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating.

You might be reading this and thinking about something else. I know I do. Most of the time I force myself to pay attention to something as simple as reading, only to come to realize that I just when through a whole page of a book or blog post without any idea of what I just read. This happens very often as my mind tends to be thinking, calculating, and materializing thoughts out of thin air almost from the moment I wake up till the time I go to sleep. Even then, I realize that I'm still thinking about things that won't let me stay connected with the present.

You might be thinking, how is relevant and/or related to coding?
Ah... you see, it's not just because of coding, or a side effect of coding. It can happen with anything. But mostly (or at least to me) it happens with coding because it's what I do for a living and on some (not all) of my spare time. So I tend to be thinking about code-related things a lot.
At first, this was very distracting to me. I'd be trying to come up with a super elegant solution to a problem, just to realize that my mind was thinking about something else... It felt as if we couldn't agree on what to focus on.

What you read at the start is a speech by Alan Watts. Once I listened to it, I kept repeating it as a mantra, and I realized that it was just what was happening to me.
A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts.
We spend so much of our day to day sitting in front of a screen, trying to solve puzzles, trying to make the impossible possible. Struggling with deadlines, clients, colleagues, meetings...

When do we have the time to just shut down?
Can't we just accept that we're overstimulated? I think we are.
But I also think that we can be open and transparent about this. And after acknowledging the issue at hand, we can try to incorporate healthier habits.

To me, these were micro habits that at the end of the day helped me lay down in my bed by being able to just listen to music without trying to make sense of it. I realized I've been missing out on what being calm is.
I won't get into much detail here, but I can just tell you, dear reader, that something as simple as incorporating a walk in the park or by a beach daily will help you ground yourself.
Whenever I feel like I have too much going on at once, I go to the nearest park and take a walk there with some lofi hip-hop, or no music at all. The truth is once I get home I feel ready to get back to work. If for some weird reason I start thinking about coding whenever I am not in front of my pc, I just let it happen... And I came to the realization that is way better to let thoughts happen than fighting them. Any kind of physical activity helps with this. I'm not very keen on yoga or meditation, but the truth is that whatever works for you might vary.

__Overthinking is the root of all evil.__

That comment you got in your pull request?
You might be overthinking about it and questioning yourself when in reality it might have been just a small thing.

That deadline you have by the end of the week?
You might be overthinking about whether or not you should update your CV as your going to be kicked off the job soon.

That algorithm that you're not proud of?
You might be overthinking about how your colleagues are way better developers because they pointed out that your code is not as elegant as it should be.

The truth is, all of this is in your head. No, really. None of those scenarios are true. They only exist in the realm of your thoughts, and they can only hurt you if you believe they are real. Take some inspiration from Mark Twain:

> I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.

I just want to be open about this - and help you understand that if you happen to overthink, you're not alone.
It takes some time to separate thoughts from reality. But once you do, the payoff is enormous... As you will not get burned out. I might write a separate post about being burned out and what to do about it. Because we've all been there.

Thank you for reading, stay awesome ðŸ’š
